blank-canvas is a Haskell port of the HTML5 Canvas API.
Tutorials and examples for the HTML5 for the HTML5 Canvas
should be trivial to port to this library.

blank-canvas works by providing a web service, that
displays the users' Haskell commands inside a browser.

There are several examples inside the 'examples' directory.

Enjoy!
